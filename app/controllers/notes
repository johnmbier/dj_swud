What does it do?
the index page has one button. Once that button is pushed, the user will
see a randomly generated "DJ Name". 

Example: DJ Darth Snumiferous

The name will consist of 2 components: 
1. a first name from the Swapi(star wars api), randomly chosen from a database of 86 characters.
   - only the first name should be returned. 

2. a randomly generated word from the "random word api".

the star wars api will require me to make it possible to randomly choose the first of the 
two components. The random word api automatically generates the second part. the 2 pieces
will combine to make up the returned
"DJ Name".
